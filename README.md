# PRATIC-PROJECT---ALGORITMICS-INTRODUCTION
This is a practical project that I developed during the introduction to algorithms course in my Computer Science course.

This project contais: 

Reading the .csv file with initial data (including strings with spaces)	

Structure with 5 or more fields, including strings with spaces and numeric data	

Dynamic memory allocation with automatic resizing	

Inserting new data at the end of the array	

Deleting records 

Updating records with option to keep previous data	

Sorting by ID, balance, and age using QuickSort algorithm (quick sort)	

Binary search by ID and age

Full and partial data printing	

Saving to CSV and binary, with corrected CSV

Menu interface with complete control	

No use of goto, vector, or sort()	

Functional menu, with option to save after sorting

Obs.: Need add the filles(arquivo.csv and clientes.bin) on the same folder that the code to work.
